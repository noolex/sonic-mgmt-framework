Description: SONiC Host Account Management Daemon (hamd)
 This daemon, hamd, runs on the host and provides user and group account
 management services. It allows applications running in containers to retrieve
 account from the host. It can also users with administrative privileges to
 create, modify, or delete user accounts on the host. For example, an admin
 user running a klish session in a containers could request hamd to create a
 new user account.

Depends: libdbus-c++-1-0v5, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: SONiC Host Account Management NSS module
 The HAM NSS module allows applications running in containers to retrieve
 host's user accounts (e.g. /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow). To do
 that, the NSS module contacts the HAM daemon (hamd) running on the host over
 DBus.

Package: sonic-certfix

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: This oneshot service is used to fix certificates at run time.
 This is an ugly kludge because SONiC does not allow running Debian postinst
 scripts on the target. Hopefully, this is temporary and somebody will fix
 the inability to run postinst on target at a later time.
